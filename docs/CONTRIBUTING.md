---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Neon Database account (free tier)
- Supabase account (free tier)

---

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `dev` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

### Making Changes

1. **Make your changes** in your feature branch
2. **Test locally** to ensure everything works
3. **Commit your changes** following commit guidelines
4. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Create Pull Request** on GitHub

---

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Define types for all function parameters and returns
- Avoid `any` type (use `unknown` if necessary)
- Use interfaces for objects, types for unions/intersections

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `MessageList.tsx`)
- Utilities: `kebab-case.ts` (e.g., `format-date.ts`)
- Types: `kebab-case.ts` (e.g., `user-types.ts`)
- API routes: `route.ts` (Next.js convention)

### Code Formatting

- Follow our predefined Prettier rules

Run before committing:

```bash
pnpm run format
```

### ESLint Rules

- No unused variables
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- No `console.log` in production code (use proper logging)
- Exhaustive dependency arrays in `useEffect`

Run linter:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

---

## Commit Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no feature change or bug fix)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, tooling, dependencies

### Examples

```bash
feat(chat): add message reactions
fix(auth): resolve login redirect loop
docs: update setup instructions in README
refactor(api): simplify workspace queries
chore(deps): update Next.js to v15.1
```

### Best Practices

- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("move cursor" not "moves cursor")
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Reference issues in footer (e.g., "Closes #123")
