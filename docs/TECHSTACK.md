## AI Integration

### Architecture Overview

Weevean uses the Vercel AI SDK to provide AI-powered features without vendor lock-in. The architecture supports multiple providers and graceful fallbacks.

### AI Provider Strategy

**Default (Cloud Deployment)**:

- Use Vercel AI Gateway for zero-config setup
- Automatic load balancing across providers
- Built-in rate limiting and caching
- No API keys needed from users

**Self-Hosted**:

- Bring your own API keys
- Choose your provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Full control over costs and data

### Cost Control

**Strategies**:

- Rate limiting: 20 requests/user/hour
- Context window limits: max 20 messages (Or chunked based on token weight)
- Model selection: Use GPT-3.5 for simple queries, GPT-4/5 for complex
- Caching: Cache similar queries for 1 hour
- Workspace quotas: Admin-configurable usage limits

### Privacy & Security

**Data Handling**:

- AI receives only necessary context (last 20 messages)
- Zero-data-retention mode enabled for all providers
- No data used for model training

**User Control**:

- Workspace-level AI disable switch
- Per-user opt-out option
- Full audit logs of AI interactions
- Transparent about what AI can see

### Future Enhancements

- **Semantic search**: Vector embeddings for message search
- **Function calling**: AI can create channels, invite users, etc.
- **Image understanding**: Analyze screenshots/diagrams
- **Voice integration**: Transcribe and summarize voice messages
- **Custom fine-tuning**: Train on workspace-specific patterns
